## Class Project for CS 4710/ 6710
## Professor: Farhan Tanvir
## Project Members: Manish Kolla, Jainam Shah, Komal Ganta

## Abstract:
This application simplifies class scheduling for Georgia State University students. It uses a user-friendly interface to create draft schedules based on past coursework, preferences, and course availability. This streamlines registration by eliminating manual scheduling conflicts, saving students valuable time.

## Project Aim:

The application helps students build draft course schedules for upcoming semesters, considering completed coursework and preferred choices.

## Motivation:

Existing scheduling tools lack the ability to automatically generate conflict-free schedules based on individual needs. This application addresses this gap by leveraging student data and preferences to create efficient, personalized schedules. Students save significant time during registration by avoiding manual conflict checks, leading to a smoother and less stressful process.
